## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
- **Inflation and food prices are strongly linked**, with developing nations facing the highest risk as food inflation surges disproportionately when overall CPI rises.  
- **The 2022â€“2024 period marked a historic spike**, driven by post-pandemic effects and the Ukraine conflict â€” Ethiopia reached 181% food inflation in 2024.  
- **High-risk countries are few but extreme**, with only 4 of 23 nations in the high-risk category averaging 18.57% inflation and over 100% food inflation in multiple years.
