# Global-Inflation-Food-Prices-Project
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing real global inflation trends and food price changes from 2010–2024. Includes key metrics, country risk classifications, and year‑over‑year comparisons to identify high‑risk regions and economic patterns.


key insights:
Inflation and food prices are strongly linked, with developing nations facing the highest risk as food inflation surges disproportionately when overall CPI rises.

The 2022–2024 period marked a historic spike, driven by post‑pandemic effects and the Ukraine conflict — Ethiopia reached 181% food inflation in 2024.

High‑risk countries are few but extreme, with only 4 of 23 nations in the high‑risk category averaging 18.57% inflation and over 100% food inflation in multiple years.
